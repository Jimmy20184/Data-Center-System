# Data Center System Deployment Manual

## Introduction

This document is a guide to install, configure and run the Data Center System of the BSN Spartan Network. This local system will help users manage their data centers and manage nodes and NTT. The system only interacts with installed full nodes of Non-Cryptocurrency Public Chains on Spartan Network, and never connects to any external third-party systems.

> As a clear demonstration, all commands in this document are run with root permission. These commands can also be run under normal user permissions, please set the file storage and configure the parameters properly.

5. Execute the rest commands in sequence. Then, check the table structure:

   ```sql
   show tables;
   ```

## 2. Download and Configuration

### 2.1 Downloading the Package

Download the [package of the Data Center Management System](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/releases/tag/v1.2.0). You can also download the source code on this page and compile it by yourself.

### 2.2 Downloading Configuration Files

Download the configuration files, including [application.yml](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.yml), [application-prod.yml](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/application-prod.yml) and [logback-spring.xml](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/src/main/resources/logback-spring.xml).

### 2.3 Configuration

#### 2.3.1 Editing `application.yml`

- Change the default login account information

  If the database has never been initialized with any account before, the service will be initialized with this information when started:

  ```yml
  system:
    adminName: admin
    adminEmail: spartan_example@hotmail.com
    defaultPassword: password
  ```

#### 2.3.2 Editing `application-prod.yml`

- Configure the data source

  ```yml
  server:
    # Specify the port that runs the Data Center System
    port: 8085
  mysql:
    # Specify the IP address, port number and the name of your database
    write_url: jdbc:mysql://database-IP:port/db_name?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull&serverTimezone=UTC&allowMultiQueries=true&useSSL=false
    # Enter the login name of the database
    write_username: db_username
    # Enter the password
    write_password: db_password
    # Specify the IP address, port number and the name of your database
    read_url: jdbc:mysql://database-IP:port/db_name?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&zeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull&serverTimezone=UTC&allowMultiQueries=true&useSSL=false
    # Enter the login name of the database
    read_username: db_username
    # Enter the password
    read_password: db_password
  ```

  Example:

  ![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/7.%20appprod.jpg?raw=true)

- Configure the email

  ```yml
  spring:
    mail:
    # The server address for the email, for exampleï¼šsmtp.gmail.com, smtp.office365.com
      host: smtp.office365.com
    # The server port
      port: 587
    # The sender address of the email
      username: spartan_example@hotmail.com
    # App password gained after enabling the two-step verification 
      password: App_password
  ```

- Configure the node information

  ```yml
   chain:
    # Default Node's JSON-RPC interface (--http.port) of Spartan-I Chain
    nodeRpcAddress: "http://node-IP:node-rpc-port"
    # Default Chain's network ID, do not change this configuration
    chainId: 9090
    # Query the transaction pool's waiting time: millisecond, recommended 1.5 seconds
    txPoolSleep: 1500
    # Change the path of the Keystore file to a designated directory
    walletFilePath: "your-directory/wallet"
    # The system will parse events from all blocks after this block height. This number is recommended to be set as the latest block height of the Default Chain before the Data Center System started. For example: blockHeight: 270441
    # You can get the block height from the blockchain explorer: https://spartanone.bsn.foundation
    blockHeight: block_height
  ```

  Example:

  ![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/8.%20prod2.jpg?raw=true)

- Configure Kong gateway

  Configure the username and password of Kong gateway

  ```yml
  kongGateWayConfig:
    # Username configured in the operations and maintenance system
    username: username
    # Password configured in the operations and maintenance system
    password: password
  ```



## 3. Starting the Service

Here we start the service in two ways, you may choose one of them that fits your requirement.

### 3.1 Starting by Package

Make sure Java 1.8 or later version has been installed in your system.

```
java -version
```

![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/5.jpg?raw=true)

Put `Data-Center-System-1.2.0.jar`, `application.yml`,  `application-prod.yml` and `logback-spring.xml` files into the same directory and run the command below:

```yml
java -jar Data-Center-System-1.2.0.jar --spring.config.location=./application.yml --spring.config.location=./application-prod.yml --logging.config=./logback-spring.xml - LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8
```

Result:
![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/9.rundatacenter.jpg?raw=true)

After starting up the Data Center System, you may find the "the basic information of data center is not configured" error message in the process. You need to configure the information after logging into the system.

If you would like to run the node in the backend system, you can run `nohup` command as follow:

```yml
nohup java -jar Data-Center-System-1.2.0.jar --spring.config.location=./application.yml --spring.config.location=./application-prod.yml --logging.config=./logback-spring.xml - LANG=zh_CN.UTF-8 > output.log 2>&1 &
```

You can also check the process from the log:

```
tail -f output.log
```

To stop the service in `nohup` mode, please refer to the below command:

```shell
# Check the PID of the service
ps -ef | grep java

# Stop the service, change "PID" to the correct number
kill -9 PID
```



### 3.2 Starting by Docker

- Create a new directory `bsn/spartan` under the root directory:
```
mkdir /bsn/spartan
```

- Go to directory  `bsn/spartan`:
```
cd /bsn/spartan
```

- Create and edit file `docker-compose.yaml`:
```
vim docker-compose.yaml
```

- Copy below content to file  `docker-compose.yaml`:

```yml
version: '3'
services:
  spartan-dc:
    container_name: spartan-dc
    image: bsnspartan/jre1.8:centos7.9
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8085:8085"
    volumes:
      - ./pkg:/bsn/spartan/pkg
      - ./logs:/bsn/spartan/logs #This directory must be the same with logPath in logback-spring.xml
      - ./conf:/bsn/spartan/conf
      - ./wallet:/bsn/spartan/wallet
      - /etc/hosts:/etc/hosts
    entrypoint: java -jar ./pkg/Data-Center-System-1.2.0.jar --server.port=8085 --spring.config.location=./conf/application.yml --spring.config.location=./conf/application-prod.yml --logging.config=./conf/logback-spring.xml --logging.logpath=./logs
```

- Create a directory `/bsn/spartan/conf` and put `application-prod.yml`, `application.yml`, `logback-spring.xml` into it.

- Create a directory `/bsn/spartan/pkg` and put `Data-Center-System-1.2.0.jar ` into it.

- Return to the directory `/bsn/spartan` and start the service:
```
cd ..
docker-compose up -d
```

## 4. Data Center Registration

After successfully starting the service, the Data Center Operator can access the system from `http://server_IP:server_port`. The `server_port` is refering to the port in `application-prod.yml`.

![](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/blob/main/images/10.DChome.jpg?raw=true)

Before using the System, the Data Center Operator should go to the [Spartan Official Website](http://spartan.bsn.foundation/) to register a new data center.

Please refer to the [BSN Spartan Network User Manual](http://spartan.bsn.foundation/static/quick-start/2gettingStarted/2-1-4.html) for detailed instructions.


## 5. Data Center Gateway Deployment

After deploying and running the Data Center Management System, Data Center Operators can deploy Kong Gateway service to manage end-user's network access. This is not a mandatory step if the Data Center Operator just wants to run the DC for his/her own system. However, for better protection of the node, we encourage all Data Center Operators to install and run the Kong Gateway. Click to see more information of [Data Center Gateway Deployment](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-Gateway).

## 6. Data Center Portal Deployment

Data Center Service Providers can build portals to serve their end-users. Here is a template of the deployment of [BSN Spartan Network Data Center Portal](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-Portal).


## 7. Data Center Management System Upgrade

If you have already installed the Data Center Management System with the previous version, you can upgrade it to the latest one.

Please find the upgrade instructions in [tags](https://github.com/BSN-Spartan/Data-Center-System/tags) that matches the version of your Data Center Management System.
